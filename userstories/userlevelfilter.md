# **User Story: Implement AD-ENT ID-Based Filtering in ART API Responses**

**As** a platform integrator,
**I want** the ART API to filter data based on the AD-ENT ID of the user making the request,
**So that** users only receive data they are authorized to access, improving security, auditability, and data governance.

---

## **Context & Assumptions**

- Authentication and token issuance are handled via OAuth and are **not changing**.
- The OAuth token includes or can be used to retrieve the **user’s AD-ENT ID**.
- Filtering logic will be applied **within the ART API** based on this ID.

---

## **Acceptance Criteria**

1. **AD-ENT ID Extraction**
   - Given a request is made to the ART API with a valid OAuth token,
   - When the ART API receives the request,
   - Then it must extract or resolve the user’s AD-ENT ID from the token or associated identity service.

2. **Data Filtering by User**
   - Given the AD-ENT ID has been resolved,
   - When the ART API prepares a response,
   - Then it must only return data associated with that user’s access permissions or business unit.

3. **Backward Compatibility Validation**
   - Given legacy clients previously received broader datasets,
   - When using a user-authenticated token,
   - Then ensure that responses are correctly scoped without breaking existing client-side logic.

4. **Audit Logging**
   - Given a filtered response is returned,
   - When the data is accessed via API,
   - Then log the AD-ENT ID, timestamp, endpoint, and number of records returned for traceability.
