Here’s a quick summary of today’s progress:

    Finalized two 5-point user stories and added them to the next sprint; a couple of related add-on stories are in progress and will be ready by Monday

    Completed the initial mapping of DS hierarchy variables to their corresponding Optimist alias IDs

    Helped resolve an accessibility issue Steven was working through related to ADA-compliant button disablement

    Actively participated in the discussion that helped clarify the JSON transformation process for the DS team prior to invoking the hierarchy script — glad to see that land cleanly

Let me know if there's anything you'd like me to reprioritize or expand on tomorrow.
