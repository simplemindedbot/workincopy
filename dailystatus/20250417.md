**Subject:** Daily Update – Wednesday, April 17

Hi Justin,

Continuing to focus on delivering with more clarity, structure, and quality — here’s a summary of today’s work:

* Following this morning’s meeting with Jothi and Diana, I spent most of the day converting DS notebook formulas into their corresponding Optimist alias IDs
* Worked through DS’s JSON output to understand and visualize the precalculated hierarchy structure
* Began documenting business requirements inferred from DS code and comments for handoff and story development
* Met with Madison to outline our approach for MNPI-related stories and began drafting initial versions
* Met with Oscar and Madison to better understand how Optimist handles user-level data segregation and how that impacts story scope

Let me know if you'd like more detail on any of these or if there's anything you'd like me to prioritize differently tomorrow.

Best,

**Scot**
